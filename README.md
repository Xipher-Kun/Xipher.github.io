## Websites I recommend
**[Anitaku]** (https://anitaku.pe/) This is my go-to for any anime series or movies that's released or currently on-going.

**[Youtube]** (https://www.youtube.com/) My best pass-time and one of the best websites for learning new things like reciples for cooking, how to dress or fix things. There is almost certainly a video about anything if not everything.
