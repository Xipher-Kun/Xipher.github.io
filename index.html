<h1> My name is Oluseun </h1>
<p>I am a CyberSecurity student. 24 years old and I enjoy coding and solving problems. In my free ô€†Ÿme, I like to read manhwas, manga, webtoons and play video games. Funt facts about games #1 The character "Sonic the Hedgehog" was originally designed with red fur. However, Sega changed it to blue to differentiate him from Mario. #2 The first video game console ever sold was the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972. It was a simple system with a black and white screen and limited gameplay options.</p>
